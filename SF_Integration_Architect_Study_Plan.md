## ‚ö° Quick Reference

**Patterns:**
- **Event Replay**: CDC + durable subscription
- **Hybrid Batch/Event**: Batch job triggers async Platform Event for downstream sync
- **API Gateway Pattern**: Central entry for multi-system orchestration

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Forgetting DLQs or replay IDs in event architecture
- Overusing synchronous callouts for large data
- Ignoring token rotation in OAuth flows
- Missing governance around API versioning
